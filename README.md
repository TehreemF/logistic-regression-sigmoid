# Logistic regression using Sigmoid function
This program implements logistic regression from scrath using Sigmoid function for a classification problem. The sample data is attached which is used to classify whether a student gets admitted into a university or not. Sigmoid function, cost function, and gradient descent for logistic regression is implemented.

Tools and Technologies used: Python, Numpy, Scipy
